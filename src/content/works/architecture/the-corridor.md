The Corridor is conceived as a **memoir** of Hong Kong’s yesteryear, choreographing visitors through a spatial narrative of approach, oppose and radiate that captures both movement and stillness. Floor, wall and roof are each articulated differently and punctuated by alcoves, creating an ever‑changing sequence where the eye gradually adjusts to darkness and reads intense streaks of light as temporal markers in space. Perched at the peak of Lion Rock, the project transposes the everyday realities of post‑war housing estates and squatter settlements into a contemplative journey, embodying the city’s enduring values of perseverance, solidarity and a can‑do spirit within a textured, atmospheric passage.​
